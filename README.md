# Oh My Zsh Terminal Support Library

This is a copy of the [termsupport library](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/lib/termsupport.zsh) for Oh My Zsh so it can be easily used outside of OMZ. Includes `omz_urlencode` from [functions library](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/lib/functions.zsh).
